Hi, Iâ€™m [Glenn Fiedler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennfiedler) the author of **gafferongames.com**. I'm a professional network programmer with 15 years experience working in the game industry.

These days I run [The Network Protocol Company](http://www.thenetworkprotocolcompany.com) which is dedicated to helping people network their games by sharing information, consulting with teams, and of course, writing articles and open source code for this website.

Before I started my own company I worked as a senior and lead programmer on many different areas of code. I started out as a graphics programmer in my first industry job way back in 1998, but very quickly became more interested in game physics and networking. In 2006 I specialized in game networking and moved to the United States. The rest, as they say, is history.

During my career I've been fortunate enough to work on some great games:

* [Titanfall 2](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/titanfall-2)
* [Titanfall](http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/titanfall)
* [God of War: Ascension](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/god-of-war-ascension)
* [Playstation: All-Stars](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/playstation-all-stars-battle-royale)
* [Journey](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/journey)
* [L.A. Noire](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/la-noire)
* [God of War 3](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/god-of-war-iii)
* [Mercenaries 2](http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/mercenaries-2-world-in-flames)
* [Tribes: Vengeance](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/tribes-vengeance)
* [SWAT 4](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/swat-4)
* [Freedom Force](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/freedom-force)

And throughout all this I've always believed strongly in sharing information. Giving back. Writing articles and example source code so people encounting the same problems I did don't have to learn everything through trial and error. 

But writing articles and open source code is just so much work. I rely on donations to pay for hosting costs and to carve out enough time from consulting to write new articles and open source code for this website.

If you enjoy the articles on this website, please support my work on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gafferongames).

Thanks for your support!
