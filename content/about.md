Hi, Iâ€™m [Glenn Fiedler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennfiedler) the author of **gafferongames.com**

These days I run [The Network Protocol Company](http://www.thenetworkprotocolcompany.com) where I consult and help peolpe network there games, but before this I was a network programmer in the AAA game industry. I lead the team that networked God of War, helped out with the networking on Journey, and worked as a network programmer on Titanfall 1 and 2.

Throughout my AAA career, I've always believed in _sharing information_. Paying it forward. I've been doing this for the past 15 years. Writing articles, talking at GDC and basically doing whatever I can do to share knowledge. It makes me _so happy_ when I meet people who learned their trade as a network programmer reading articles I that wrote 10 years ago.

And now there's even more stuff I want to write about. But writing quality articles takes _so much time_ and I need to earn enough money each month to pay rent and health insurance. Because of this, I rely on sponsorship to carve out time to work on articles and open source code.

So if you enjoy my articles and open source code, please [sponsor my work](http://www.patreon.com). Not only does your support encourage me to create more articles and open source code, you also get access to [example source code](http://www.patreon.com/gafferongames) for articles on gafferongames.com

__Cheers and thanks for your support!__
