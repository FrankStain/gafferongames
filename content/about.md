Hi, Iâ€™m [Glenn Fiedler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennfiedler) the author of **gafferongames.com**

These days I run [The Network Protocol Company](http://www.thenetworkprotocolcompany.com) where I help people network their games. Previously, I was a network programmer in the AAA game industry. I lead the team that networked God of War, helped out with the networking on Journey, and worked as a network programmer on Titanfall 1 and 2.

Throughout my AAA career, I've always believed strongly in sharing information. Paying it forward. Writing articles, doing GDC talks and sharing example source code so people encounting the same problems don't have to learn everything through trial and error.

And now there is even more stuff I want to write about, but original research and writing quality articles takes so much time! Because of this, I rely on donations and sponsorships to carve time out from consulting to spend on articles and open source code.

If you enjoy the articles on this website, and you'd like to encourage me to write more, [please support my work on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gafferongames).

Thanks for your support!
