Hi, Iâ€™m [Glenn Fiedler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennfiedler) the author of **gafferongames.com**.

These days I run [The Network Protocol Company](http://www.thenetworkprotocolcompany.com) where I help people network their games.

Before this I was a network programmer in the AAA game industry. I lead the team that networked God of War, helped out with the networking on Journey, and worked as a network programmer on Titanfall 1 and 2.

And throughout my AAA career, I've always believed strongly in sharing information. Paying it forward. Writing articles, doing GDC talks and sharing example source code so people encounting the same problems I did don't have to learn everything through trial and error. You can see this from the long list of articles I've been able to publish over the last 10 years.

I can tell you that it's super gratifying to see 10 years later a new generation of network programmers who grew up reading my stuff. They come up and tell me "I read your articles 10 years ago and decided to become a network programmer!". Wow!

I'd like to continue writing. There is plenty more networking knowledge I have left to write about, but taking time away from consulting (which pays the bills) is difficult, so I rely on donations carve out time from consulting and sponsorship to write new articles and open source code.

If you enjoy the articles on this website, and you'd like to read more, please support my work on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gafferongames).

Thanks for your support!
