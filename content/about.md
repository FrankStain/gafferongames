Hi, Iâ€™m [Glenn Fiedler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennfiedler) the author of **gafferongames.com**. I'm a professional game network programmer with 15 years experience working in the game industry. 

These days I run [The Network Protocol Company](http://www.thenetworkprotocolcompany.com) where I develop custom software and help people network their games. In my spare time I write open source code and articles for this website.

Before I started my own company I worked on the following titles:

* [Titanfall 2](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/titanfall-2)
* [Titanfall](http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/titanfall)
* [God of War: Ascension](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/god-of-war-ascension)
* [Playstation: All-Stars](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/playstation-all-stars-battle-royale)
* [Journey](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/journey)
* [L.A. Noire](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/la-noire)
* [God of War 3](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/god-of-war-iii)
* [Mercenaries 2](http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/mercenaries-2-world-in-flames)
* [SWAT 4](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/swat-4)
* [Freedom Force](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/freedom-force)

One thing I believe strongly in is sharing information. This website exists for that purpose. I hope you enjoy the articles on this website and the open source code I create such as [libyojimbo](http://www.libyojimbo.com).

If you would like to support my work, you can do that on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gafferongames).

Thanks!
