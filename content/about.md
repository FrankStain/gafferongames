Hi, Iâ€™m [Glenn Fiedler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennfiedler) the author of **gafferongames.com**

These days I run [The Network Protocol Company](http://www.thenetworkprotocolcompany.com), but before this, I was a network programmer in the AAA game industry. I lead the team that networked God of War, helped out with the networking on Journey, and worked as a network programmer on Titanfall 1 and 2.

Throughout my AAA career, I've always believed in _sharing information_. Paying it forward. Writing articles, doing GDC talks and sharing example source code so people encounting the same problems don't have to learn everything through trial and error like I did.

And now there is even more stuff I want to write about, but original research and writing quality articles takes _so much time_. Because of this, I rely on donations and sponsorships to carve time out from consulting to work on articles and open source code.

If you enjoy my articles and open source code, [please support my work](https://www.patreon.com/gafferongames).

Thanks for your support!
