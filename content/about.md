Hi, Iâ€™m [Glenn Fiedler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennfiedler) the author of **gafferongames.com**

These days I run [The Network Protocol Company](http://www.thenetworkprotocolcompany.com), but before this, I was a network programmer in the AAA game industry. I lead the team that networked God of War, helped out with the networking on Journey, and worked as a network programmer on Titanfall 1 and 2.

Throughout my AAA career, I've always believed in _sharing information_. Writing articles, doing GDC talks and sharing example source code so people encounting the same problems don't have to learn everything from scratch.

And now there is even more stuff I want to write about. But original research and writing quality articles takes _so much time_. I rely on donations and sponsorships to carve out time to work on articles and open source code.

So if you enjoy my articles and open source code, please [support my work](http://www.patreon.com) on Patreon. Supporters get access to exclusive content, like example source code for articles and early access to work in progress.
