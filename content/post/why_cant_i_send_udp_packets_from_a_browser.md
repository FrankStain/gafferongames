# Introduction

In 2017 the most popular web games like [agar.io](http://agar.io) are effectively limited to networking with WebSockets over TCP. If a UDP equivalent of WebSockets could be standardized and incorporated into browsers, it would greatly improve the networking of these games.

# Background

Web browsers are built on top of HTTP, which is a stateless request/response protocol initially designed for serving static web pages. HTTP is built on top of TCP, which is a low-level protocol that guarantees that all data arrives reliably, and in the same order it was sent. 

This worked well for many years, but recently websites are becoming more interactive and recent developments like WebSockets, WebRTC, HTTP 2.0 and SPDY hold the potential to greatly improve the quality and interactivity of the web. 

Unfortunately, the current set of standards for web development either don't provide what games need, or provide it in a form that is too complicated for game developers to integrate.

This leads to frustration from game developers, who just want to be able to send UDP packets from the browser.

b) Example 2 with citations (140 words)

(insert headline here)

5. Straw Solution 1

a) Describe solution briefly (60 words)

b) Expert quote on why it doesn't work (70 words)

6. Straw Solution 2

a) Describe solution briefly (60 words)

b) Expert quote on why it doesn't work (70 words)

(insert headline here)

(here I would like to outline what the real solutino would look like? eg. connection based, ddos proof, authenticated, encrypted).

7. Introduce real solution

a) Explain what it is (70 words)

b) Explain why it is better than straw solution 1 and straw solution 2 (90 words)

c) Expert quote on why it's better.

(insert headline here)

8. Real solution addresses first major concern

a) introduce concern 1 (30 words)

b) how the real solution addresses it (90 words)

c) citation to support this (not possible...). replace with "how it works" section.

9. Real solution addresses second major concern 

a) introduce concern 2 (30 words)

b) how the real solution addresses it (90 words)

c) citation to support this (not possible!). replace with "how it works" section?

10. Real solution addresss third major concern 

a) introduce concern 3 (30 words)

b) how the real solution addresses it (90 words)

(insert headline here)

11. One example of a company or individual succeeding with the real solution (125 words). (not possible, this is a new thing. what to replace this with?)

(insert headline here)

12. 3 more advantages of real solution

a) advantage 1 (125 words)

b) advantage 2 (125 words)
