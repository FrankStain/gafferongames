    What's the next best article to bring across quickly?

    Maybe the next "Virtual Go" article, it's pretty lightweight, it's just bringing across images that are frustrating somewhat.

    Urgh. "The Go Stone" article has a bunch of math, so I'm going to have to find a latex plugin for Hugo? Hopefully? Pretty please?!

    Ugh... There is one that uses JavaScript:

        https://gohugo.io/tutorials/mathjax/

    But this is not accessible to RSS... big problem.

    This guy has a solution, but it's a lot of work that requires post-processing the generated RSS, I could do this, no problem:

        http://latkin.org/blog/2016/08/07/better-tex-math-typesetting-in-hugo/

    Basically, it uses Javascript Latex for web, and then falls back to image generated latex for RSS. Not particularly great.

    Starting option is probably just to use the image generating service, then optimize the web javascript version to get better text quality.

    -----------------

    Finish writing "Client Server Connection"

    -----------------

    Port across the existing "Game Networking" series.

    -----------------

    Port across the "Virtual Go" article series.

    -----------------

    Get nice syntax highlighting working:

    https://gohugo.io/extras/highlighting/

    Definitely want to do this on page generation rather than javascript, so it works well inside an RSS feed.

    -----------------

    Port across rest of "Game Physics" series.

    -----------------

    Port across the rest of "Building a Game Network Protocol" series.

    -----------------

    Research a good way to get a sitemap and discoverability on gafferongames.com, eg. menus, local search, sidebar with sitemap... something equivalent to what I currently have on gafferongames.com is essential for discoverability and driving people towards the patreon for articles they want to read.

    People fundamentally need to be see the structure of articles planned, and want the next one in the series... this is key. Cannot lose this.

    -----------------

    Need to remember to fix the link to next article in "Introduction to Virtual Go". 

    It currently points to the old gafferongames.com

    -----------------

    Need to setup up http permanent redirects from old gafferongames URLs to the new hugo URLs

    I should be able to just go over each article and find its URL on the old gafferongames and setup nginx config for this redirection I think.

    -----------------

    Need to remember to properly link up next/previous in "Game Networking" article series.

    Also some conclusions need padding out, and the example source code needs to be updated and downloadable.

    -----------------

    The title for "Sending and Receiving Packets" splits across two lines. This looks crap. It should go wide on one line.

    -----------------

    Need to remember to update links in "Deterministic Lockstep" to old gafferongames.com to the new articles as written.

    Probably want to grep through all my MD files to look for any links to gafferongames

    -----------------

    "Fix your Timestep!" could probably use a conclusion and some discussion of the cost of the interpolation, and the input latency at the end.

    Also discuss extrapolation as an option, and if you keep going down this path, you basically reinvent the quake network model.
