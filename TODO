    Setup crontab to start gafferongames docker compose automatically on reboot

    Testing in now by rebooting linode.

    Ahhhhh... the sudo is making it fail. I can't make a sudo run like that. Edit root crontab instead.

    Testing... Yes. This works fine!

TODO

    After this, only thing remaining is to do something to make testing effective when running local nginx docker compose setup... eg. base url. how?!

    Also, setup pipelining for the redis commands. Don't be lame.

    Setting up wordpress now. A docker volume persists the db. This is how it works.
