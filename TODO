    Need to get email forwarding working again for glenn@thenetworkprotocolcompany.com

    ------------------

    Fuck! I completely forgot about "Reliable Ordered Messages" in "Building a Game Network Protocol"!

    ------------------

    Put patreon support links at the bottom of each article.

    ------------------

    ------------------

    Once new networked physics article is up, I can publish the source code for gafferongames.com on github.

    This will allow people to apply push requests for spelling mistakes, which actually would be pretty cool.

    ------------------

    Things to do:

        1. Make redis database persist with volume

        2. Map webserver.go with volume, and make go detect when the source file has changed, then rebuild the server.

        3. Map nginx.conf with volume and make nginx restart whenever the config file is changed.

        4. Setup DNS so libyojimbo.com is redirected through my web server as well.

        5. Complete migration of domains over to namecheap.com
