DONE

    First I just need to get the new gafferongames setup on some URL, eg. new.gafferongames.com

    I'm having trouble setting this up right now because cloudflare is coming through a CGI default url file, which is weird.
        
    Fix new.gafferongames.com showing without stylesheet. Why?!

    Fixed, I had the incorrect location for the URL in the upload toml config, so it couldn't find supporting resources.

TODO

    Mark "client/server connection" article as draft. Will need to rework it before it can be turned on again.

    Mark the virtual go articles as drafts. They need a solution for equations that work well in browser and in RSS feed before I can turn them on again.

    Make sure all published articles have footers, eg. call to action -> patreon.

    Pass over and improve the about section.

    Fix old gafferongames.com video links

    Improve netcode.io README.md
