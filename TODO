DONE

    First I just need to get the new gafferongames setup on some URL, eg. new.gafferongames.com

    I'm having trouble setting this up right now because cloudflare is coming through a CGI default url file, which is weird.
        
    Fix new.gafferongames.com showing without stylesheet. Why?!

    Fixed, I had the incorrect location for the URL in the upload toml config, so it couldn't find supporting resources.

    Mark "client/server connection" article as draft. Will need to rework it before it can be turned on again.

    Mark the virtual go articles as drafts. They need a solution for equations that work well in browser and in RSS feed before I can turn them on again.

    Pass over and improve the about section.

    Improve netcode.io README.md

    Fix old gafferongames.com video links

    Mostly done, but now getting some weird stuff again with the cloudflare -> linode.

    Maybe cloudflare needs to be whitelisted?

    Yes. Some code needs to be setup to periodically get cloudflare IPs and whitelist them, and mark them as "get real IP behind this" if I'm going to do any whitelisting behind them.

    For now, since everything on new.gafferongames.com is behind cloudflare, I'm going to turn off all my fail2ban and bans and see what happens.

TODO

    Testing videos now... work fine on old gafferongames.com

    There are some broken videos in the ported across code. Fixing those now.
