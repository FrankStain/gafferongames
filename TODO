    Things to do:

        1. Make redis database persist with volume

        2. Map webserver.go with volume, and make go detect when the source file has changed, then rebuild the server.

        3. Map nginx.conf with volume and make nginx restart whenever the config file is changed.

        4. Setup DNS so libyojimbo is redirected through my web server as well.

        5. Map log files with docker volumes so I can easily tail files to watch what's going on.
