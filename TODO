TODO

    ------------------

    Port across initial articles in building a game network protocol.

    ------------------

    Fix up gross "Client/Server Connection" article.

    ------------------

    Get all articles cross-linked so they have next/prev, patreon links etc.

    ------------------

    Need a solution for migrating my old wordpress website, *or* a solution for completely converting the virtual go math across.

    I'd prefer to convert the math... fuck wordpress.

    ------------------

    Need a way to convert old article links (especially popular ones), to the new hugo based site.

    If an older article or link is not converted across (eg. the content and so on), then redirect to front page.

    ------------------

    Study google analytics to work out common landing pages, make sure they all have equivalents on the new website.

    ------------------

    Things to do:

        1. Make redis database persist with volume

        2. Map webserver.go with volume, and make go detect when the source file has changed, then rebuild the server.

        3. Map nginx.conf with volume and make nginx restart whenever the config file is changed.

        4. Setup DNS so libyojimbo.com is redirected through my web server as well.

        5. Complete migration of domains over to namecheap.com
