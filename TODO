TODO

    -----------------

    Port across "UDP vs. TCP"

    -----------------

    Finish writing "Client Server Connection"

    -----------------

    Get nice syntax highlighting working:

    https://gohugo.io/extras/highlighting/

    Definely want to do this on page generation rather than javascript, so it works well inside an RSS feed.

    -----------------

    Port across rest of "Game Physics" series.

    -----------------

    Port across the existing "Game Networking" series.

    -----------------

    Port across the "Virtual Go" article series.

    -----------------

    Port across the rest of "Building a Game Network Protocol" series.

    -----------------

    Research a good way to get a sitemap and discoverability on gafferongames.com, eg. menus, local search, sidebar with sitemap... something equivalent to what I currently have on gafferongames.com is essential for discoverability and driving people towards the patreon for articles they want to read.

    People fundamentally need to be see the structure of articles planned, and want the next one in the series... this is key. Cannot lose this.

    -----------------

    Need to remember to fix the link to next article in "Introduction to Virtual Go". It currently points to the old gafferongames.com

    -----------------

    Need to setup up http permanent redirects from old gafferongames URLs to the new hugo URLs

    I should be able to just go over each article and find its URL on the old gafferongames and setup nginx config for this redirection I think.
