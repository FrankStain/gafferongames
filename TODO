TODO

    Tidy up and get "Client Server Connection" article in good enough format for supporters to provide feedback.

    This should be extended to include diagrams and images to explain concepts, as well as source code examples that are final.

    Make it obviously better than the previous drafts, it should show progress.

    Research a good way to get a sitemap and discoverability on gafferongames.com, eg. menus, local search, sidebar with sitemap... something equivalent to what I currently have on gafferongames.com is essential for discoverability and driving people towards the patreon for articles they want to read.

    People fundamentally need to be see the structure of articles planned, and want the next one in the series... this is key. Cannot lose this.

    I dislike the all white (hard to read) wall of text of "Posted by X on Y in Z tags {t}" under the article Heading.

    This is hard to parse and different to scan. I want to color the bits that aren't links differently to the links for easier scanning.
    
    Want to get RSS feed working, and an RSS button at the bottom ideally along with the social buttons.
