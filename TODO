    Setup crontab to start gafferongames docker compose automatically on reboot

    Testing in now by rebooting linode.

    Ahhhhh... the sudo is making it fail. I can't make a sudo run like that. Edit root crontab instead.

    Testing... Yes. This works fine!

    Setting up wordpress now. A docker volume persists the db. This is how it works.

    After much fucking around, I had to manually override the wp-config.php to get it to work.

    However, it's not running the setup process, or at least, I don't know how to log in.

    Seems like I have to expose the port so I can setup w. apache directly, then once it's setup, I can do the redirect.

    Fuck the other option, it seems that wordpress doesn't get setup that way. Shit software... =p

    Fuck it. It's not worth the time fucking around with this.

    netcode.io redirect is working again.

    I need a better workflow for upgrading and changing website content while dockerized nginx is running.

    How can I create a volume for the docker files, and then make changes to this volume from outside the container while it's running?

    It must be possible. I need to do this to make it possible to upload website changes without bringing the whole website down!

    Done. Mapped videos and website public to the docker as read only, so the files can be modified without restarting the container.

TODO

    Next I need to make redis persist with a volume. I don't want to lose all the redis stuff when the container shuts down (eg. bans)

    If I want that to go away, I can remove the volume manually.

    Ahahah. I caught the hacker, and then he started spinning up instances on subnets, eg. x.y.z.*

    To fix this, I wildcarded the last number in the IP address so they're all considered together.

    This is probably overly aggressive, but might send the right message. Eat shit and die. He'll run his scripts tonight, and it'll pick him up.

    I probably want to relax this, because if people are browsing from a corporate network at the same time, they'll probably get nailed.

    But again, they'll probably get nailed if they are browsing that way with the IP check (with NAT)

    So really, is there any way to solve this without nailing some people. Probably not. Fuck it. Just keep the bans temp.

    On this note, the ban on total amount downloaded is probably a bad idea (both on single IP with NAT, and especially with wildcard).

    Think this through, after seeing how the hacker handles this.

    As far as I can tell, the hacker has slowed down rate of download, and is splitting it across multiple IPs.

    I'll catch him, but be super aggressive, persist the keys longer, so if he downloads the same file more than 10 times in 24 hours, he gets the ban.

    Right now it's 10 times in 1 hr, which may fail to pick him up if he goes real slow. I want to catch him if he goes slow though.

    Seems like the hacker is also slicing the downloads, eg. downloading 512kb at a time. I won't pick him up quickly this way.

    However, he can't do any real damage this way either...

    Some logic I could run is to add another key, and if he hasn't hit this file in the last 10 second or so, but it is > 100 bytes read, treat it as a whole read.

    This is aggressive, but it would catch him doing salami reads like this.

    It's annoying and hard to read seeing the old values. Would be much better if I logged at the end of the function with completely updated values.
