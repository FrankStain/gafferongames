DONE

    Removed contact page. Too many people asking me stupid fucking questions. Do my homework.

    Updated reliable-ordered messages article.

    Added link

    Improved the about page. I can update it again later if the situation changes.

    Make sure RSS feed is working

TODO

    Get https://netcode.io

    ------------------

    Need to get email forwarding working again for glenn@thenetworkprotocolcompany.com

    To do this I think I just need to open the correct ports in iptables firewall on my linode box.

    ------------------

    Get the network protocol company website back up in some form

    ------------------

    Pass over networked physics article and improve it.

    ------------------

    Publish networked physics article and publicize it.

    ------------------

    Once new networked physics article is up, I can publish the source code for gafferongames.com on github.

    This will allow people to apply push requests for spelling mistakes, which actually would be pretty cool.

    ------------------

    Things to do:

        1. Make redis database persist with volume

        2. Map webserver.go with volume, and make go detect when the source file has changed, then rebuild the server.

        3. Map nginx.conf with volume and make nginx restart whenever the config file is changed.

        4. Setup DNS so libyojimbo.com is redirected through my web server as well.

        5. Complete migration of domains over to namecheap.com
