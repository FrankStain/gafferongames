TODO

    ------------------

    Implement closed form damped simple harmonic oscillator.

    -----------------

    God I really hate plot.ly. It's so fucking slow. Is there a better solution for graphing that I can use locally?

    -----------------

    Get nice syntax highlighting working:

    https://gohugo.io/extras/highlighting/

    Definely want to do this on page generation rather than javascript, so it works well inside an RSS feed.

    -----------------

    Port across the existing "Networked Physics" article series.

    Check them in both the browser and in the RSS reader. Do videos show up in RSS readers? Kindof a bummer if they don't!

    -----------------

    Find way to speed up video upload

    Either a) get smart and delta it with git for the upload step, or separate out the upload of the videos from the rest of the content.

    Videos don't change often so no point waiting 30 seconds for them to upload everytime I make a small change.

    -----------------

    Finish writing "Client Server Connection"

    -----------------

    Port across the existing "Game Networking" series.

    -----------------

    Port across the "Virtual Go" article series.

    -----------------

    Research a good way to get a sitemap and discoverability on gafferongames.com, eg. menus, local search, sidebar with sitemap... something equivalent to what I currently have on gafferongames.com is essential for discoverability and driving people towards the patreon for articles they want to read.

    People fundamentally need to be see the structure of articles planned, and want the next one in the series... this is key. Cannot lose this.

    -----------------

    This could be a convenient option for hosting the static website content, but probably not the videos:

    https://www.aerobatic.com

    Not sure it really beats my nginx option though.

    Auth looks nice though for supporter only articles:
