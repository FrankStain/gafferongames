DONE

    Removed contact page. Too many people asking me stupid fucking questions. Do my homework.

    Updated reliable-ordered messages article.

    Added link

    Improved the about page. I can update it again later if the situation changes.

    Make sure RSS feed is working

    Fixed patreon links. 

TODO

    Networked physics article needs to be cut down. Simply can't start with so image heavy, and then drop down to no images mid-way through the article (and I can't sustain that many images throughout the rest of the article...).

    Things to do:

        1. Make redis database persist with volume

        2. Map webserver.go with volume, and make go detect when the source file has changed, then rebuild the server.

        3. Map nginx.conf with volume and make nginx restart whenever the config file is changed.

        4. Setup DNS so libyojimbo.com is redirected through my web server as well.

        5. Complete migration of domains over to namecheap.com
