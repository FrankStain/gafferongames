    Added timestamp to logging.
        
TODO

    I'd like to write a script that prints out the list of people who are currently banned.

    Would be cool if my webserver.go could detect itself being modified and quit, then I could have a loop in a script where it keeps building itself, running again, etc. This would really speed up iteration.

    To really detect sneaky downloads, I need to wait 10 seconds and query if any other writes have occurred. Testing small writes at the start gives false positives.
