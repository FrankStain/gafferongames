DONE


TODO

    ------------------

    I'm hesitant to really get into symplectic euler because it's above my current level of ability. It would make a good follow up article to cover symplectic integrators.

    It might be good to explain that RK4 is not symplectic, and it was originally design for integrating a single equation from derivative, not a second order ode.

    Mentioning hamiltonians and providing links for further study into hamiltonians would give people the ability to explore further.

    Also linking to more advanced symplectic higher order integrators.

    ------------------

    Need to finish writing the next section, symplectic vs. non-symplectic integrators.

    This is really a beyond RK4 section. It's going to be a bit hand wavey with links for further study.

    No. I think it should be in the conclusion, or it's a lead up to the conclusion, and then the conclusion is just very short.


    I checked through the guys code and looking at his code I think he's actually an idiot.

    Also watch Erin Catto's GDC presentation on integrators: http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022197/Physics-for-Game-Programmers-Numerical

    -----------------

    After this, presuming I haven't totally fucked up RK4, it is time to grab the set of graphs to compare RK4 with implicit euler.

    -----------------

    Finally, if I can be arsed, it might be interesting to add another section "Beyond RK4"

    If anything, this should be done for completeness. RK4 is not the only high order method!

    Here is some very interesting stuff:

    -----------------

    Rewrite the conclusion

    -----------------

    Get nice syntax highlighting working:

    https://gohugo.io/extras/highlighting/

    Definely want to do this on page generation rather than javascript, so it works well inside an RSS feed.

    -----------------

    Port across the existing "Networked Physics" article series.

    Check them in both the browser and in the RSS reader. Do videos show up in RSS readers? Kindof a bummer if they don't!

    -----------------

    Find way to speed up video upload

    Either a) get smart and delta it with git for the upload step, or separate out the upload of the videos from the rest of the content.

    Videos don't change often so no point waiting 30 seconds for them to upload everytime I make a small change.

    -----------------

    Finish writing "Client Server Connection"

    -----------------

    Port across the existing "Game Networking" series.

    -----------------

    Port across the "Virtual Go" article series.

    -----------------

    Research a good way to get a sitemap and discoverability on gafferongames.com, eg. menus, local search, sidebar with sitemap... something equivalent to what I currently have on gafferongames.com is essential for discoverability and driving people towards the patreon for articles they want to read.

    People fundamentally need to be see the structure of articles planned, and want the next one in the series... this is key. Cannot lose this.

    -----------------

    This could be a convenient option for hosting the static website content, but probably not the videos:

    https://www.aerobatic.com

    Not sure it really beats my nginx option though.

    Auth looks nice though for supporter only articles:
