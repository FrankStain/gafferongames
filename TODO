DONE

TODO

    Finish converting across articles, as much as possible...

    Every article except the Virtual Go series, as far as I am concerned (because of the Latex)

    This means, finish porting across the physics articles (and probably, not editing them too much...)

    Finish porting across the networked physics articles

    Finish porting across the building a game network protocol

    ------------------

    Get all articles cross-linked so they have next/prev, patreon links etc.

    Need a solution for migrating my old wordpress website into docker. How to do this?

    ------------------

    Things to do:

        1. Make redis database persist with volume

        2. Map webserver.go with volume, and make go detect when the source file has changed, then rebuild the server.

        3. Map nginx.conf with volume and make nginx restart whenever the config file is changed.

        4. Setup DNS so libyojimbo is redirected through my web server as well.

        5. Complete migration of domains over to namecheap.com
