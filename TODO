TODO

    Port across the "Virtual Go" article series.

    Just one article remaining, but then a bunch of work potentially to get the Latex equations working properly in Javascript *and* RSS. Ugh.

    Try to get this done on Sunday. I don't want this to drag on much further.

    In fact, it might be a good idea to skip ahead from the latex to port over more articles from other series first.

    Think about it tomorrow, but do as *much as possible* on Sunday.

    -----------------

    Finish writing "Client Server Connection"

    -----------------

    Port across the existing "Game Networking" series.

    -----------------

    Get nice syntax highlighting working:

    https://gohugo.io/extras/highlighting/

    Definitely want to do this on page generation rather than javascript, so it works well inside an RSS feed.

    -----------------

    Port across rest of "Game Physics" series.

    -----------------

    Port across the rest of "Building a Game Network Protocol" series.

    -----------------

    Research a good way to get a sitemap and discoverability on gafferongames.com, eg. menus, local search, sidebar with sitemap... something equivalent to what I currently have on gafferongames.com is essential for discoverability and driving people towards the patreon for articles they want to read.

    People fundamentally need to be see the structure of articles planned, and want the next one in the series... this is key. Cannot lose this.

    -----------------

    Need to setup up http permanent redirects from old gafferongames URLs to the new hugo URLs

    I should be able to just go over each article and find its URL on the old gafferongames and setup nginx config for this redirection I think.

    -----------------

    Need to remember to properly link up next/previous in "Game Networking" article series.

    Also some conclusions need padding out, and the example source code needs to be updated and downloadable.

    -----------------

    The title for "Sending and Receiving Packets" splits across two lines. This looks crap. It should go wide on one line.

    -----------------

    Need to remember to update links in "Deterministic Lockstep" to old gafferongames.com to the new articles as written.

    Probably want to grep through all my MD files to look for any links to gafferongames

    -----------------

    "Fix your Timestep!" could probably use a conclusion and some discussion of the cost of the interpolation, and the input latency at the end.

    Also discuss extrapolation as an option, and if you keep going down this path, you basically reinvent the quake network model.

    -----------------

    Need to do a lot of linking from the end of virtual go articles to the next, as they tend to peter out a little bit with no conclusion. They're really the same article built up across several, so I need to strongly link to the next one in the article text.

    -----------------

    Need a solution for bringing across the math. Bunch of research below. Critically, it needs to work both in HTML and in RSS.

    This guy has a solution, but it's a lot of work that requires post-processing the generated RSS, I could do this, no problem:

        http://latkin.org/blog/2016/08/07/better-tex-math-typesetting-in-hugo/

    Basically, it uses Javascript Latex for web, and then falls back to image generated latex for RSS. Not particularly great.

    Starting option is probably just to use the image generating service, then optimize the web javascript version to get better text quality.

    Katex is here:

        https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/

    Need to hook something up like this. I should be able to do it.

    -----------------

    It's bad that there is not a lot of visibility right now for articles in a series back *to* that series as a whole.

    Also, within a series I would like to display article summaries automatically, not just lists of articles with their tags -- of course their tags will all be the same, they're all in the same article series!

    I probably need some professional help to get this website into the form I am looking for.

    I have good content, but the presentation needs to improve. Pulling the trigger on a blank website without final polish, especially if it is backwards in terms of discoverability of new articles could be a mistake.

    But I do need to get this finished by the end of the year.

    So I have to do my best, and then work on visual improvements in parallel once the website conversion is completed.

    -----------------

    The youtube links inside the virtual go articles kind of suck.

    It would be nice to convert them to my own video hosting.

    -----------------

    Search for "gafferongames.com" for any stale links before going live

    In fact, why not write a script to parse my markdown for stale links? This could be fun.

    -----------------

    Impulse j general response equation in "Collision Response and Coulomb Friction" would be nice to convert from an image to an actual equation. The image is low resolution.
