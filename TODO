DONE

    Port across game physics articles.

    Port across game networking articles.

    Port across state synchronization article.

    Found a good way to unify site layout. It's very article focused. Not suitable for blog-like posts.

    Brought across building a game network protocol articles (first pass)

    Pass over "Reading and Writing Packets"

    Pass over "Serialization Strategies"

    Pass over "Packet Fragmentation and Reassembly"

    Pass over "Sending Large Blocks of Data"

    Pass over "Client/Server Connection"

    Pass over "Integration Basics" again.

    Pass over "Fix your timestep!" again.

    Pass over "Physics in 3D" article.

    Pass over "Spring Physics" article.

    Pass over "Networked Physics (2004)" article. (argh...)

    Pass over "Networked Physics" article series again.

    Linked together networked physics article series.

    Link together "Building a Game Network Protocol" articles.

    Link together "Game Physics" articles.

    Pass over original "Game Networking" article series (quickly...)

    Link together "Game Networking" articles.

    Pass over "Virtual Go" articles.

    Link together articles.

    If an older article or link is not converted across (eg. the content and so on), then redirect to front page.

TODO

    Need a way to convert old article links (especially popular ones), to the new hugo based site.

    ------------------

    Fuck! I completely forgot about "Reliable Ordered Messages" in "Building a Game Network Protocol"!

    ------------------

    Make new gafferongames.com live with DNS redirect

    ------------------

    Update the about page. It can be much better.

    ------------------

    Research solutions for Latex for Virtual Go article series.

    ------------------

    Once new networked physics article is up, I can publish the source code for gafferongames.com on github.

    This will allow people to apply push requests for spelling mistakes, which actually would be pretty cool.

    ------------------

    Things to do:

        1. Make redis database persist with volume

        2. Map webserver.go with volume, and make go detect when the source file has changed, then rebuild the server.

        3. Map nginx.conf with volume and make nginx restart whenever the config file is changed.

        4. Setup DNS so libyojimbo.com is redirected through my web server as well.

        5. Complete migration of domains over to namecheap.com
