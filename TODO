    Setup crontab to start gafferongames docker compose automatically on reboot

    Testing in now by rebooting linode.

    Ahhhhh... the sudo is making it fail. I can't make a sudo run like that. Edit root crontab instead.

    Testing... Yes. This works fine!

    Setting up wordpress now. A docker volume persists the db. This is how it works.

    After much fucking around, I had to manually override the wp-config.php to get it to work.

    However, it's not running the setup process, or at least, I don't know how to log in.

    Seems like I have to expose the port so I can setup w. apache directly, then once it's setup, I can do the redirect.

    Fuck the other option, it seems that wordpress doesn't get setup that way. Shit software... =p

    Fuck it. It's not worth the time fucking around with this.

TODO

    Time is better spent:

        1. Converting remaining content to new.gafferongames.com

        2. Setting up redirects for popular URLs linked to gafferongames.com

        3. Getting netcode.io redirect working again

        4.
