TODO

    Need to work out how to mark drafts so they don't get generated in "upload", but do get generated in local.

    This is important so I can make small changes to the website, but it doesn't upload stuff that isn't ready for the general public yet.

    -----------------

    Finish writing "Client Server Connection"

    -----------------

    Port across the existing "Networked Physics" article series.

    -----------------

    Port across the existing "Game Networking" series.

    -----------------

    Research a good way to get a sitemap and discoverability on gafferongames.com, eg. menus, local search, sidebar with sitemap... something equivalent to what I currently have on gafferongames.com is essential for discoverability and driving people towards the patreon for articles they want to read.

    People fundamentally need to be see the structure of articles planned, and want the next one in the series... this is key. Cannot lose this.

    I dislike the all white (hard to read) wall of text of "Posted by X on Y in Z tags {t}" under the article Heading. Clean this up visually.
