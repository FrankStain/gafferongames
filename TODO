    Port across game physics articles.

    Port across game networking articles.

    Port across state synchronization article.

    Found a good way to unify site layout. It's very article focused. Not suitable for blog-like posts.

    Brought across building a game network protocol articles (first pass)

    Pass over "Reading and Writing Packets"

    Pass over "Serialization Strategies"

    Pass over "Packet Fragmentation and Reassembly"

    Pass over "Sending Large Blocks of Data"

TODO

    Pass over "Client/Server Connection"

    ------------------

    Pass over "Networked Physics" article series again.

    ------------------

    Write "Securing Dedicated Servers"

        -- focus on the packet encryption, securing etc, HMAC, sequence # stuff, nonce, replay protection. not on the key exchange.

        -- packet structure with AEAD. etc.

    ------------------

    Update the about page. It can be much better.

    ------------------

    Get all articles cross-linked so they have next/prev, patreon links etc.

    ------------------

    Need a solution for migrating my old wordpress website, *or* a solution for completely converting the virtual go math across.

    I'd prefer to convert the math... fuck wordpress.

    ------------------

    Need a way to convert old article links (especially popular ones), to the new hugo based site.

    If an older article or link is not converted across (eg. the content and so on), then redirect to front page.

    ------------------

    Study google analytics to work out common landing pages, make sure they all have equivalents on the new website.

    Any post that no longer has a direct analog should the main index of articles as a default.

    ------------------

    Once new networked physics article is up, I can publish the source code for gafferongames.com on github.

    This will allow people to apply push requests for spelling mistakes, which actually would be pretty cool.

    ------------------

    Things to do:

        1. Make redis database persist with volume

        2. Map webserver.go with volume, and make go detect when the source file has changed, then rebuild the server.

        3. Map nginx.conf with volume and make nginx restart whenever the config file is changed.

        4. Setup DNS so libyojimbo.com is redirected through my web server as well.

        5. Complete migration of domains over to namecheap.com
