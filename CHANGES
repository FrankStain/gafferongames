===========================

    Flatten down the theme and just make it all static content. I don't intend on ever refreshing or sharing them. I'm going to modify it and make it my own.

    Works fine.

    I dislike the all white (hard to read) wall of text of "Posted by X on Y in Z tags {t}" under the article Heading. Clean this up visually.

    Worked through all the templates and cleaned up the blog title so it only has who posted it and date. I think this is cleaner.

    Summary still retains category and tags in the "archive".

    Decided to rework all links to my name to the about section on my website. Why drive traffic to linkedin? I want it to stay on my website really.

==============================

    Tested RSS feed, it's working great, but it doesn't need a link or anything. You just point the RSS reader at my URL and it does the rest.

    Adjusted the email icon at the bottom to link to the contact page. Doesn't seem worthwhile to have the contact page if you just provide a direct email link in the footer =p

    Doing it this way avoids sharing my email address for spambots, which is probably a good thing.

    Worked out how to get drafts not rendering in the "upload" version of the website, but still rendered in local.

    This is important so I can make small changes to the website, but it doesn't upload stuff that isn't ready for the general public yet.

    Tweaked the about page a bit more.

    Rewrote the introduction to "Client Server Connection".

    Spent some time working out how to get an upload test for the website. Right now I'm just going to do it manually.

    Even more passing over and extending the intro. It flows really well. The previous "standard" intro for the article series was too stilted.

    Now it flows right in to "why do the best games build their own custom client/server protocol on top of UDP?" and then it spends a whole section answering this question, with a final segway to: OK this is what we are doing. Building the client/server connection concept, because UDP does not provide it.

    I like it.

    Wrote about page.


Sunday 25th September, 2016
===========================

    Stripped site back to just one article for now: "Client Server Connection".

    Added "Support gafferongames.com" menu item that links directs to patreon.com

    Hooked up and tested contact form.
