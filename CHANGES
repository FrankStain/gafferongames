==============================

    Tested RSS feed, it's working great, but it doesn't need a link or anything. You just point the RSS reader at my URL and it does the rest.

    Adjusted the email icon at the bottom to link to the contact page. Doesn't seem worthwhile to have the contact page if you just provide a direct email link in the footer =p

    Doing it this way avoids sharing my email address for spambots, which is probably a good thing.

    Tweaked the about page a bit more.

    Rewrote the introduction to "Client Server Connection".

    Spent some time working out how to get an upload test for the website. Right now I'm just going to do it manually.

    Even more passing over and extending the intro. It flows really well. The previous "standard" intro for the article series was too stilted.

    Now it flows right in to "why do the best games build their own custom client/server protocol on top of UDP?" and then it spends a whole section answering this question, with a final segway to: OK this is what we are doing. Building the client/server connection concept, because UDP does not provide it.

    I like it.
