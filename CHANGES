    Grabbed images for:

        1. semi-implicit euler undamped at 0.25

        2. RK4 undamped at dt 0.25

    I've pretty much finished the section comparing RK4 with implicit euler.

    ------------------

    The next step is to verify that my RK4 is actually RK4, and that my reasoning and explanation is basically sound.

    Start here: http://www.gamedev.net/topic/679116-how-does-runge-kutta-4-work-in-games/

    As far as I can tell, the person complaining about my code being wrong is an idiot. They think I should have extra divide by twos, but they don't provide any reasoning for that. Also, their code is filled with C++ retarded operator overloading which demonstrates that they are a poor programmer and have difficulty reading C code.

    Confirmed. The person is wrong. They are multiplying by dt twice. This is incredibly ignorant of them to post as if they are correct. I'll let them wear that.

    It's pretty obvious looking at the code is their definition of "more accurate" is comes to zero faster because that's how they print it out. At no point is he comparing it against the analytical solution or doing any work at all to justify his claim that his fucked up version of RK4 is more accurate.

    Moving on. This person is a fool.

    Implement closed form for the damped spring and output the data

    https://www.ncsu.edu/crsc/events/ugw05/slides/root_harmonic.pdf

    ^--- Actually, this result seems wrong. y0*y0? Are you sure. Seems like it should be y0 + ...

    Added closed form for mass spring system with zero initial velocity, cosine.

    Now comparing this vs. RK4 and implicit euler solutions...

    -----------------

    Research shows that the implicit euler integration at 100fps matches the exact solution almost precisely.

    As does the RK4...

    -----------------

    Compared RK4 and semi-implicit euler with exact solution for undamped at 10HZ

    However, at 10HZ the implicit euler has a different phase to the RK4, while the RK4 has the correct phase, but loses energy!

    This is very interesting result. This is something worth writing about!

    -----------------

    Compare my 2nd order RK4 implementation to others. Have I actually implemented it correctly?!

    Reading through this:

    http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/721076/help-with-using-the-runge-kutta-4th-order-method-on-a-system-of-2-first-order-od

    I think that I have it working correctly, it's just that I have already split up into position and velocity functions, whereas the specification of a typical 2nd order ODE is x'' - x' + c = 0. So it needs splitting apart into a form that I am used to working with.

    The code in this answer seems to match my answer, but implemented in an obviously different way, so it is not clearly derived from it.

    -----------------

    Implement closed form damped simple harmonic oscillator.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator

    https://www.ncsu.edu/crsc/events/ugw05/slides/root_harmonic.pdf

    The result is that looking zoomed out, implicit euler and RK4 both match very closely. Hardly noticeable.

    Zoomed in, it is clear that RK4 follows the exact result closer.

    This is worth writing about.

    -----------------

    Need to flesh out the section on the spring damper system.

    -----------------

    Grabbed basic diagrams for the RK4 vs. semi-implicit euler comparison.

    Wrote that section.

==========================

    Bunch of work on the integration basics article.

    Setup a new testbed for this article series with explicit and implicit euler integrators.

    Integration Basics:

    Get RK4 working with the spring damper system.

    Output all results to text and csv files.

    Find a good way to render high quality graphs: http://plot.ly

    Did a bunch of research. I have a lot to fix in the article. Specifically, I cannot just blanket recommend RK4 or even hint to this. Symmetric euler is good enough.

    Also, my RK4 implementation may be slightly incorrect.

===========================

    Flatten down the theme and just make it all static content. I don't intend on ever refreshing or sharing them. I'm going to modify it and make it my own.

    Works fine.

    I dislike the all white (hard to read) wall of text of "Posted by X on Y in Z tags {t}" under the article Heading. Clean this up visually.

    Worked through all the templates and cleaned up the blog title so it only has who posted it and date. I think this is cleaner.

    Summary still retains category and tags in the "archive".

    Decided to rework all links to my name to the about section on my website. Why drive traffic to linkedin? I want it to stay on my website really.

    Added all networked physics videos to the data directory. Lets see what this does to iteration time :D

    It seems that hugo is smart enough not to copy across assets that aren't referred to from articles? Or it's not copying across the data directory?

    Port across the existing "Game Physics" series.

    Mostly done with this, but I need to:

    Calculate the result with dt=0.01f

==============================

    Tested RSS feed, it's working great, but it doesn't need a link or anything. You just point the RSS reader at my URL and it does the rest.

    Adjusted the email icon at the bottom to link to the contact page. Doesn't seem worthwhile to have the contact page if you just provide a direct email link in the footer =p

    Doing it this way avoids sharing my email address for spambots, which is probably a good thing.

    Worked out how to get drafts not rendering in the "upload" version of the website, but still rendered in local.

    This is important so I can make small changes to the website, but it doesn't upload stuff that isn't ready for the general public yet.


Tuesday 27th September, 2016
============================

    Tweaked the about page a bit more.

    Rewrote the introduction to "Client Server Connection".

    Spent some time working out how to get an upload test for the website. Right now I'm just going to do it manually.

    Even more passing over and extending the intro. It flows really well. The previous "standard" intro for the article series was too stilted.

    Now it flows right in to "why do the best games build their own custom client/server protocol on top of UDP?" and then it spends a whole section answering this question, with a final segway to: OK this is what we are doing. Building the client/server connection concept, because UDP does not provide it.

    I like it.


Monday 26th September, 2016
===========================

    Wrote about page.


Sunday 25th September, 2016
===========================

    Stripped site back to just one article for now: "Client Server Connection".

    Added "Support gafferongames.com" menu item that links directs to patreon.com

    Hooked up and tested contact form.
