    Article on smallest 3 representation that explores the set of smallest 3 representation in 32 bits, and stability of conversion in/out with floating point.

    Article exploring symplectic integrators for the equations of motion. Basically, a follow up to the RK4 article exploring symplectic integrators in more detail.

    Article explaining what physics engines can do to make networked physics work better with their engines (especially, quantization).

    Network compression challenge part 2. With position, orientation (expanded 4) and linear and angular velocity. Don't publish my code initially. But publish my results as a challenge to beat. The trick will be that I have excellent prediction working already. Do this after I finish with Oculus and the sample code is public.
